## Features

### Dual Backend Support

| Backend | GPU Requirement | Best For |
|---------|-----------------|----------|
| **llama.cpp** | Maxwell 5.2+ (GTX 900, Quadro M4000) | GGUF models, older GPUs, CPU offload, single-stream chat, **Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) & draft-model speculative decoding** for 1.5–2× tok/s on DeepSeek-V3/R1, Qwen3-Next-MTP, and Qwen3.5/3.6-MTP variants |
| **sglang** | Turing 7.5+ (RTX 20-series, T4) — driver R570+ recommended | High-throughput concurrent serving, RadixAttention prefix caching, GGUF + safetensors + AWQ/GPTQ/FP8/NVFP4, native `--tool-call-parser` and `--reasoning-parser` for Qwen / DeepSeek / GLM / Kimi / Llama-3/4 / Mistral / GPT-OSS |

### Core Capabilities

- **HuggingFace Integration** — Search and download GGUF models directly
- **Auto-Configuration** — Optimal settings based on hardware detection
- **Real-time Monitoring** — WebSocket-based live logs, status, and download progress
- **Multi-User Support** — Authentication with session management and API keys
- **OpenAI-Compatible API** — Drop-in replacement for OpenAI endpoints
- **Vision Models** — Send images to vision-capable models (LLaVA, Qwen-VL) with OCR fallback for non-vision models
- **Thinking Models** — Parse and display reasoning from models like DeepSeek R1 and Qwen QwQ
- **Audio Transcription** — Built-in `transcribe_audio` skill (faster-whisper, bundled `small.en` model, CPU-only, runs in the sandbox)
- **Spreadsheets & SQL in chat** — `read_xlsx` (openpyxl) and `query_sqlite` skills let the model read XLSX files and run SELECTs (or DDL with `readonly=false`) against SQLite databases in the workspace
- **Document Generation** — `create_pdf` and `create_docx` skills render Markdown (including GFM tables) to PDF/DOCX, persisted to `/workspace/artifacts/`; a `contentFile` param accepts large input that would exceed the tool-arg token cap
- **Image Editing** — `transform_image` skill (Pillow) for resize, crop, thumbnail, rotate, format-convert, and grayscale operations
- **Auto-Download Chips** — Any file a sandboxed skill writes to `/workspace/artifacts/` is auto-promoted into a download chip in the chat (mtime-filtered so prior turns don't re-surface); `make_downloadable` promotes existing workspace files explicitly
- **Map-Reduce Chunking** — Automatically splits large content across multiple model calls and synthesizes results
- **AIMem Memory Compression** — Compresses older conversation history to reduce token usage, speeding up inference and lowering VRAM consumption during long conversations
- **Knowledge Base (RAG)** — Upload per-user document collections (PDF / DOCX / XLSX / text / CSV / Markdown); the chat model retrieves only the most relevant passages via the `search_knowledge_base` tool, so large libraries never strain the context window
- **Background Streaming** — Responses continue server-side if you navigate away, saved on completion
- **Auto-Continuation** — Automatically continues truncated responses up to 8 times

### Native Tool Calling

The chat model can invoke tools on its own via OpenAI-style function calls. Every enabled skill in your workspace is surfaced to the model as a named tool; the UI renders each call as an inline chip showing the tool name, arguments, and (on click) the full result. There are no "web search" or "URL fetch" toggles anymore — the model decides when to reach for them.

- **Catalog built from your skill registry** — toggling a skill off in Settings removes it from the tool catalog the model sees on the next turn
- **Streamed tool chips** — `native_tool_call` events render live below the assistant message while the model works
- **Multi-round reasoning** — the model can call several tools in sequence and see each result before responding
- **Shipped tools include** — `web_search` (DuckDuckGo → Scrapling → Brave → Playwright fallback chain), `fetch_url` (direct file download for PDF/DOCX/XLSX then Scrapling/Playwright/axios for HTML), `crawl_pages`, `playwright_fetch` / `playwright_interact` for JS-rendered pages, `scrapling_fetch` for CAPTCHA-evading fetches, `search_knowledge_base` (semantic retrieval over the user's uploaded documents), `dns_lookup`, `virustotal_lookup`, `base64_decode`, `extract_strings` (printable-string extraction from binaries), plus every built-in skill (file ops, git, system info, OCR, PDF, email parsing, and more)
- **No silent dead-ends** — if the tool-iteration cap is reached, the model still returns a final user-visible message

### Web Scraping & Search

- **[Scrapling](https://github.com/D4Vinci/Scrapling) Integration** — CAPTCHA-evading web scraping with StealthyFetcher
- **Multi-Engine Search** — DuckDuckGo → Scrapling → Brave Search → Playwright
- **Smart Content Extraction** — Playwright SPA/XHR interception, direct file download for PDFs/DOCX/XLSX

### AIMem — Memory Compression

Long conversations consume increasing amounts of context window and VRAM. AIMem compresses older messages before they're sent to the model, reducing token count while preserving all factual content.

- **4-stage pipeline** — Semantic deduplication, lossy prompt compression, symbolic shorthand, and relevance-gated retrieval
- **~48% token reduction** with 100% fact retention (benchmarked across 47 strategy combinations)
- **Faster responses** — Fewer input tokens means faster time-to-first-token and lower VRAM pressure
- **Transparent** — Enable per-model via the "Compress Memory" toggle in the model manager; all clients (Chat UI, API) respect the setting automatically
- **Smart triggering** — Only activates when conversations have 6+ messages and input exceeds 60% of available context, keeping short conversations untouched

### Knowledge Base — Retrieval-Augmented Generation

Upload documents into per-user **knowledge bases** and the chat model references them on demand. Retrieval is **semantic** and only ever pulls the most relevant passages, so a multi-gigabyte library never blows the context window.

- **Manage in the webapp** — a **Knowledge Base** tab (left nav) to create knowledge bases, upload/remove documents, and test retrieval. Each user sees their own; **admins see every user's** with an owner badge.
- **Broad ingestion** — extracts text from PDF, DOCX, XLSX, Markdown, CSV, JSON, HTML and plain text, then splits it into overlapping chunks.
- **Fast, local embeddings** — a resident CPU engine (`model2vec` `potion-retrieval-32M`, 512-dim, pure NumPy — no GPU, no PyTorch) embeds chunks once and answers warm queries in well under a millisecond; falls back to a lexical hashing index if the model is unavailable.
- **The model retrieves automatically** — a `search_knowledge_base` native tool is surfaced only when the user has a knowledge base; the model calls it when an answer may live in your documents and cites the source filename. Top-k snippets keep it cheap to call repeatedly.
- **No database service** — collection metadata lives in `knowledge-bases.json` and each KB's chunks + vectors in a per-KB SQLite file under `/models/.modelserver/knowledge-bases/`.

### Chat Interface

Lightweight React + Tailwind CSS chat UI at `https://localhost:3002`:

- Native tool-call chips rendered inline with each assistant message
- 18 themes and 6 chat layouts (Default, Centered, Timeline, Bubbles, Slack, Minimal)
- 54 font choices with dynamic Google Fonts loading
- Clipboard image paste and drag-and-drop file attachments
- Paste-as-file for large text (500+ chars auto-converted to attachment)
- Email file parsing (.eml, .msg) with nested attachment extraction
- OCR text extraction for uploaded images via Tesseract

  <em>The model decides to call <code>web_search</code>, reads the results, and follows up with <code>scrapling_fetch</code> to pull a full page — each call appears as a clickable chip below the response.</em>
</p>

### Pi (pi.dev) — Terminal UI

The terminal experience for this project is **[Pi](https://pi.dev)** (`@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`), a third-party minimal coding harness — we don't ship our own TUI, we wire Pi in. Install Pi once, drop in the bundled extension, and any model loaded in **My Models** becomes a Pi-driven coding agent backed by the 130+ skills the webapp already exposes.

- **Pi handles the local FS** — read/write/bash/edit/grep run on the user's `$PWD` via Pi's built-ins, not on the server's `/workspace`
- **Skills surface as Pi tools** — the bundled extension at `webapp/pi-extension/modelserver.ts` registers each enabled skill (`web_search`, `fetch_url`, `playwright_*`, `scrapling_fetch`, OCR, PDF, email parsing, …) and proxies execution to `/api/skills/:name/execute`
- **Real context window** — `/v1/models` is augmented server-side to inject the running instance's actual `context_window`, so Pi's status line and auto-truncation match the loaded model's true ceiling instead of defaulting to 32k
- **Real token usage** — `/v1/*` streaming requests inject `stream_options.include_usage: true` and tap the SSE for the final usage chunk, so per-key token counters update on every Pi turn instead of sitting at `0/max`
- **Bearer-mode API key required** — the Pi extension uses `Authorization: Bearer <key>`, so create a bearer-only key in the **API Keys** tab
- **Auto-config in Docs tab** — the install one-liner, `settings.json` snippet, and extension package are all pre-baked with your API key + endpoint

### Automation — Workflow Engine

A first-party visual **workflow engine** is built into the chat UI (the **Automation** button next to "+ New chat") — no external service, no extra container. Workflows drive the **locally served LLMs** and the same sandboxed skill catalog the chat uses, and run **manually, on a schedule, by webhook, on a system event, or from a Telegram/Slack message**.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/automation-flow.png" alt="Automation editor showing an example change-monitor flow: Schedule → Fetch data → Parse JSON → Database: Store → If new → Summarize → Notify" width="900">
</p>

- **Build & edit with LLM** — describe the automation you want and the model assembles the nodes + wiring (**Build with LLM** under *New automation*); or open an existing one and **Edit with LLM** to apply a change in plain language — you preview the diff (added / changed / removed steps) before it saves.
- **Palette** — drag-and-drop nodes grouped into **Triggers** (Manual, Schedule, Webhook, On Event, Loop), **Tools** (Model, Web Search, Fetch URL, HTTP Request, Crawl Pages, Parse JSON, Render HTML/Chart, SQLite, Create PDF/File, **Run Python**, …), **Connectors** (Slack & Telegram — each with new-message trigger / send / get), and **Logic Gates** (If/Else, Switch, Filter, Merge, Delay, Set). A live search filters the palette.
- **Database nodes** — *Database: Store* keeps a persistent per-workflow SQLite collection; set a unique **key** (with optional ignore-words, normalize, and a comma-separated fallback like `link,post_title`) to deduplicate and emit only newly-seen records as `.new` — i.e. **change-tracking across runs**. *Database: Query* reads rows back (newest-first, or a raw `SELECT` a model can generate) to feed a model, Telegram, or a file.
- **Robust logic gates** — text operators (equals, contains, starts/ends with, regex, `>`, `<`, is-empty, …); a blank *Value to check* defaults to the previous node's output.
- **Data wiring** — reference any upstream step with `{{nodes.<id>.field}}` tags; the config panel lists clickable tags from all upstream nodes (with expected fields shown before a run). Independent non-LLM steps at the same depth run **in parallel**.
- **Runnable everywhere** — build it in the UI or drive it over the API: `POST /api/automations/:id/run-sync` (plus full CRUD under `/api/automations`). Persists to `/models/.modelserver/` — no database service required.

> **Example change-monitor:** `Schedule → HTTP Request (API) → Parse JSON → Database: Store (key) → If/Else (new is not empty) → Model → Telegram` — fetches a feed daily, stores it with a dedup key, and pings you only when genuinely-new items appear.

## Prerequisites

**Required:** Docker 24.0+ with Compose v2, Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+), 4GB RAM minimum (8GB+ recommended)

**Optional:** NVIDIA GPU with Container Toolkit, HuggingFace token (for gated models)

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/frontierstack/Open-Source-Model-Manager.git
cd Open-Source-Model-Manager

# Optional: set HuggingFace token
echo "HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN=hf_xxx" > .env

# Build and start (~20-25 min first time)
./build.sh && ./start.sh
```

| Interface | URL |
|-----------|-----|
| Web UI | https://localhost:3001 |
| Chat UI | https://localhost:3002 |

### Build Options

```bash
./build.sh                         # Parallel build (default)
./build.sh --no-parallel           # Sequential (low memory)
./build.sh --no-cache --no-resume  # Force full rebuild
```

### Windows + WSL2 Setup (no Docker Desktop)

If you're running on Windows via WSL2 and don't want Docker Desktop, `wsl-setup.sh` installs a real systemd-managed Docker Engine inside the distro so `./build.sh` and the gVisor sandbox both work natively:

```bash
sudo ./wsl-setup.sh                 # Auto-detect GPU, install gVisor
sudo ./wsl-setup.sh --no-gpu        # Skip nvidia-container-toolkit
sudo ./wsl-setup.sh --no-gvisor     # Skip gVisor runtime
sudo ./wsl-setup.sh --cleanup       # Wipe all containers/images/volumes (destructive)
sudo ./wsl-setup.sh --cleanup -y    # Same, no confirmation prompt
```

The script is idempotent. If it needs to enable systemd in `/etc/wsl.conf`, it prints the exact `wsl --shutdown` command to run from PowerShell and exits — re-run after the distro restart and it picks up where it left off.

**LAN access from other computers** (so other machines on the network can reach `https://<windows-ip>:3001`) requires WSL2 mirrored networking. On the Windows host, create `%UserProfile%\.wslconfig`:

```ini
[wsl2]
networkingMode=mirrored
firewall=true
dnsTunneling=true
autoProxy=true

[experimental]
hostAddressLoopback=true
```

Then from PowerShell:

```powershell
wsl --shutdown
# After WSL restarts, open the firewall (Admin PowerShell):
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "ModelServer 3001" -Direction Inbound -LocalPort 3001 -Protocol TCP -Profile Any -Action Allow
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "ModelServer 3002" -Direction Inbound -LocalPort 3002 -Protocol TCP -Profile Any -Action Allow
# If WSL's Hyper-V firewall is gating traffic too:
Set-NetFirewallHyperVVMSetting -Name '{40E0AC32-46A5-438A-A0B2-2B479E8F2E90}' -DefaultInboundAction Allow
```

Mirrored mode requires Windows 11 build 22621+ and WSL 2.0.0+. On older Windows, use `netsh interface portproxy` rules instead.

## Usage

### Web Interface

1. Navigate to https://localhost:3001
2. Register account (first user = admin)
3. **Discover** — Search and download models
4. **My Models** — Launch and manage instances
5. **API Keys** — Generate access tokens
6. **Knowledge Base** — Upload documents the model can reference (semantic RAG)
7. **Docs** — API code builder with 70+ endpoints in 4 languages

> Tip: drag the left-nav items to reorder them — your layout is saved per user.

### Pi (pi.dev) — terminal coding agent

```bash
# Install Pi (once) — https://pi.dev
npm install -g @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent

# Open the webapp Docs tab → "Pi setup" → copy the settings.json snippet
# (it bakes in your API key + the local /v1 endpoint), drop it at:
#   ~/.pi/agent/settings.json

# Install the bundled skill-catalog extension (one-liner shown in Docs tab —
# pulls webapp/pi-extension/modelserver.ts to ~/.pi/agent/extensions/modelserver/)
curl -sk https://localhost:3001/api/pi/install | bash

# Run from any project directory
pi
```

The extension auto-fetches the user's enabled skills on startup and registers each as a Pi tool, so the 130+ default skills (web search, URL fetch, code navigation, file ops, OCR, PDF, email parsing, …) are available without further configuration. Pi handles the local FS via its built-in `read`/`bash`/`edit`/`write`; the modelserver tools target server-side concerns (web, attachments, sandbox runs) so the two don't shadow each other.

> **Set the env vars before `pi`.** The extension reads `MODELSERVER_API_KEY` (a **bearer-mode** key from the API Keys tab) and `MODELSERVER_BASE_URL` at startup — without the key it skips provider + skill registration. The installer appends `MODELSERVER_BASE_URL` to your shell rc, but keep `MODELSERVER_API_KEY` exported in your shell (don't commit it).
>
> **Troubleshooting — `401 "Invalid or inactive Bearer token"` on the model call** (but skills still work): you have a **stale extension** from an older install. Older copies registered the provider with `apiKey: "MODELSERVER_API_KEY"` (the env-var *name*), which current Pi sends as a literal token. The shipped extension uses `apiKey: "$MODELSERVER_API_KEY"` (leading `$` = env-var reference) — **re-run `curl -sk …/api/pi/install | bash` to refresh it.** Re-running the installer after any Pi upgrade is the general fix for a stale extension.

### API

OpenAI-compatible endpoints work with any OpenAI SDK client:

```bash
curl -sk https://localhost:3001/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "model-name", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]}'
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(base_url="https://localhost:3001/v1", api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="model-name",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)
```

---

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN=hf_xxx         # For gated model downloads
HOST_IP=192.168.1.100                  # Container networking (auto-detected)
HOST_MODELS_PATH=/mnt/d/models         # Override models path (Windows+WSL)
NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0         # SSL bypass for corporate proxies
SESSION_SECRET=your-secret             # Auto-generated if not set
```

### Ports

| Service | Port | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|

**Data Persistence:** All user data stored in `./models/.modelserver/` as JSON files (agents, skills, conversations, API keys with AES-256-GCM encryption). Model containers mount `./models` read-only.

**Sandbox image:** Skills that run user-provided code (or any of the new media skills — `transform_image`, `transcribe_audio`, `read_xlsx`, `query_sqlite`, `make_downloadable`) execute inside a ~2.6GB gVisor-isolated sandbox image with `faster-whisper`, `ffmpeg`, Pillow, openpyxl, and a bundled `small.en` Whisper model preloaded.

**Automation Engine:** The visual workflow engine runs **in-process** inside the webapp — no extra service or container. It's a branch-pruning DAG executor (`webapp/services/automationEngine.js`) over a `{ nodes, edges }` graph with `{{...}}` data templating, reusing the same auth, sandboxed skills, and locally-served models. Triggers fire **manually, on a schedule** (one 5s `setInterval` tick, epoch-aligned intervals + cron), **by webhook, on a system event, or from a Telegram/Slack poll**; independent nodes at the same depth execute in parallel. Stateful nodes (`Database: Store`, `Track Changes`) keep per-workflow SQLite in a sandbox `automation-<id>` workspace for dedup/change-tracking across runs. An LLM **Build/Edit** path assembles workflows from a plain-language prompt and can **test-run and self-repair** them — running the graph, inspecting each node's output (and re-running to verify "only new/changed" logic) until the goal is met. Workflows, run history, and node types persist to `/models/.modelserver/` as JSON — no database service required.

**Knowledge Base (RAG):** A resident CPU embedding engine (`webapp/services/kb_engine.py`, spawned and supervised by `webapp/services/knowledgeBaseService.js`) loads `model2vec`/`potion-retrieval-32M` once and answers semantic queries over a loopback HTTP port — no GPU, no PyTorch, no extra container. Uploaded documents are extracted and chunked in Node, embedded by the engine, and stored as per-KB SQLite (chunk text + normalized vectors) under `/models/.modelserver/knowledge-bases/`; collection metadata lives in `knowledge-bases.json`. The chat model retrieves on demand through the `search_knowledge_base` native tool, which returns only top-k snippets so context stays small regardless of library size. (Note: the `/v1/*` passthrough does not inject the server tool catalog, so KB retrieval is automatic in the webapp/chat UI but not over raw `/v1` or Pi.)

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Build fails / interrupted | `./build.sh` (auto-resumes) |
| Out of memory during build | `./build.sh --no-parallel` |
| Corrupted build state | `rm -rf .build-state/ && ./build.sh` |
| Model OOM errors | Reduce GPU layers, use q8_0/q4_0 cache type |
| Port 3001 in use | `netstat -tulpn \| grep 3001` to find conflict |
| GPU not detected | Reinstall NVIDIA Container Toolkit, test with `nvidia-smi` |
| SSL/corporate proxy errors | `echo "NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0" >> .env` |

```bash
# Common diagnostic commands
docker compose logs -f webapp       # View webapp logs
docker compose ps                   # Check service status
nvidia-smi                          # Check GPU
docker stats                        # Container resource usage
```
